## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules?
  Modules in JavaScript are reusable pieces of code that can be imported and exported between files. They allow developers to divide a program into smaller, more manageable parts, promoting reusability and maintainability.
- What is the difference between named and default imports?
  named imports allow us to import specific pieces of code (functions, variables, classes) by their exported names. import { item }
  Default Imports used when a module has a default export, allowing us to import the primary functionality of the module without naming it explicitly. import item
- What is the difference between named and default exports?
  Named Exports allow us to export multiple things from a single module. Each exported item has its own name.
  Default Exports allow us to export a single main function, class, or object from a module. There can only be one default export per module.
